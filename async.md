# Async Await

In ES2015 Promises were meant to solve a problem with asynchronouse code and solve the callback hell problem. Though they did help they had some of the same issues as callbacks as well as a complexity issue. When async functions were introduced which is just promises with a better syntax this helped code look like it was synchronous but in reality it is non-blocking behind the scenes.
